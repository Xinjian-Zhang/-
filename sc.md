Here is the prototype, the Figma-based web page. We focus on the reader's perspective, and narrow down the scope of borrowing books sequence.

First, we are in the first page, the digital library called DW Library. And we click the login button.

Now, the login component is shown. Due to the partnership between the library and the university, we can use the University account to login. then, continue with UT Account.

Now, we can use UT credentials to login.

We fill in the username: digital warriors's email,

and password, then click the sign in button.

Now, we are in the main page, here lists the recommended books, based on the user's preference, borrowing history, showing lots of books related to the programming.

There is a search bar on the top, and the tags of search options.
Let's take our RE's lecturer, Professor Raimundas as an example. Fill in his name, and select  the author option, then click the search button.

The query result is shown, and we get 4 results.

The 1st book, Secure System Modeling, Specification, is one we are interested in. Click the book cover, 

and we can see the details of the book. Like Author, Publisher, ISBN, and the description of the book.
On the bottom, there is a ituative emoji, now is a smile face, representing the book is available. And we click the borrow button.

Now, we're in the borrowing page, we need to select the borrowing period on the calendar, and click the confirm button.

Then, select the preferred pickup date, and click the confirm button.

Here we have the double confirmation request, to make sure the reader is aware of the borrowing period and pickup date. Click the confirm button.

Ok, now the borrowing process is done. We can explore more books.
